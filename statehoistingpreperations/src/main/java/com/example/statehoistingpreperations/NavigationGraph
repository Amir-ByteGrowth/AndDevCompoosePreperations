Navigation

Navigation refers to the interactions that let users navigate across, into, and back out from the
different pieces of content within your app.
Android Jetpack's Navigation component includes the Navigation library, Safe Args Gradle plug-in,


Key concepts

The following table provides an overview of the key concepts in navigation and the main types that you use to implement them.

Concept

Purpose

Type

Host
A UI element that contains the current navigation destination. That is, when a user navigates through an app, the app essentially swaps destinations in and out of the navigation host.
Compose: NavHost
Fragments: NavHostFragment
Graph
A data structure that defines all the navigation destinations within the app and how they connect together.
NavGraph
Controller
The central coordinator for managing navigation between destinations. The controller offers methods for navigating between destinations, handling deep links, managing the back stack, and more.
NavController
Destination
A node in the navigation graph. When the user navigates to this node, the host displays its content.
NavDestination

Typically created when constructing the navigation graph.
Route
Uniquely identifies a destination and any data required by it.

You can navigate using routes. Routes take you to destinations.


Benefits and features

The Navigation component provides a number of other benefits and features, including the following:

    1- Animations and transitions: Provides standardized resources for animations and transitions.
    2- Deep linking: Implements and handles deep links that take the user directly to a destination.
    3- UI patterns: Supports patterns such as navigation drawers and bottom navigation with minimal additional work.
    4- Type safety: Includes support for passing data between destinations with type safety.
    5- ViewModel support: Enables scoping a ViewModel to a navigation graph to share UI-related data between the graph's destinations.
    6- Fragment transactions: Fully supports and handles fragment transactions.
    7- Back and up: Handles back and up actions correctly by default.

 Design your navigation graph


 The Navigation component uses a navigation graph to manage your app's navigation. The navigation
 graph is a data structure that contains each destination within your app and the connections between
 them.

 Note: The navigation graph is distinct from the back stack, which is a stack within the NavController
 that holds destinations the user has recently visited.
 Destination types

 There are three general types of destinations: hosted, dialog, and activity. The following table
 outlines these three destination types and their purposes.

 Type

 Description

 Use cases

 Hosted
 Fills the entire navigation host. That is, the size of a hosted destination is the same as the size
  of the navigation host and previous destinations are not visible.
 Main and detail screens.
 Dialog
 Presents overlay UI components. This UI is not tied to the location of the navigation host or its size.
  Previous destinations are visible underneath the destination.
 Alerts, selections, forms.
 Activity
 Represents unique screens or features within the app.
 Serve as an exit point to the navigation graph that starts a new Android activity that is managed
 separately from the Navigation component.

 In modern Android development, an app consists of a single activity. Activity destinations are
 therefore best used when interacting with third party activity


  Jetpack Compose Navigation, NavController and NavHostController are both used to manage navigation within a Compose application, but they have different purposes and functionalities.

 NavController
 1- Purpose: NavController is the core class used for navigating between composable destinations. It manages the navigation state and back stack for a navigation graph.
 2- Usage: It provides basic navigation capabilities, such as navigating to a different route, popping the back stack, and navigating with arguments.
 3- Common Methods:
    navigate(route: String): Navigate to a destination by route.
    popBackStack(): Pop the back stack.
    navigateUp(): Navigate up in the hierarchy.
 NavHostController
 Purpose: NavHostController is a subclass of NavController that is specifically designed to work with NavHost composable. It adds additional functionality required to manage the lifecycle and state of the navigation host.
 Usage: It provides more advanced navigation capabilities and is typically used internally by the NavHost composable. When you call rememberNavController(), it returns an instance of NavHostController.
 Common Methods: Inherits all methods from NavController, but also manages state restoration and lifecycle-aware components within the navigation host.

Navigate Up VS PopBackStack
navigateUp() will also pop the top fragment from the backstack, if there is any.

For starters: If you arrived at your current destination from within your app, they act exactly identical.

ONLY if you arrived at the current destination with a deeplink from a different app, they will behave differently:

navigateUp() will leave your app and return to the app that navigated to the deep link in your app.

popBackStack() will attempt to go back one step in your backstack, and will not do anything if there is no backstack entry.


Destinations can be grouped into a nested graph to modularize a particular flow in your app’s UI. An
example of this could be a self-contained login flow.
A nested graph groups its destinations, just like the main graph, and it requires a designated start
destination for its associated route, which is where you’ll go when you access that nested graph’s route.
To add a nested graph to your NavHost, you can use the navigation extension function:
NavHost(navController, startDestination = "home") {
    ...
    // Navigating to the graph via its route ('login') automatically
    // navigates to the graph's start destination - 'username'
    // therefore encapsulating the graph's internal routing logic
    navigation(startDestination = "username", route = "login") {
        composable("username") { ... }
        composable("password") { ... }
        composable("registration") { ... }
    }
    ...
}
It is strongly recommended that you split your navigation graph into multiple methods as the graph
grows in size. This also allows multiple modules to contribute their own navigation graphs.
