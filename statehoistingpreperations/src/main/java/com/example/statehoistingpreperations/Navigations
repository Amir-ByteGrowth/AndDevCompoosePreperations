what is difference between navigation destination and route?

In the context of navigation within Jetpack Compose (or other Android navigation libraries),
"destination" and "route" are related but distinct concepts. Here’s the difference between the two:

Route
Definition: A route is essentially a unique identifier for a screen or a destination within the
navigation graph. It is a string that is used to define and recognize a particular point in the
navigation graph.
Usage: Routes are used to specify where the navigation should go when a navigation action is triggered.
When navigating to a new screen, you typically pass the route string to the navigation controller.
Destination
Definition: A destination represents a specific screen or a target in the navigation graph where the
user can navigate to. Each destination is associated with a route.
Usage: Destinations are defined in the navigation graph and can represent composable screens, dialogs,
or other targets. A destination can have associated actions, arguments, and other configuration options.
Example in Jetpack Compose Navigation
Here’s a simple example to illustrate the difference:

kotlin
Copy code
// Define routes
const val homeRoute = "home"
const val detailsRoute = "details/{itemId}"

// Setup NavHost
NavHost(navController, startDestination = homeRoute) {
    // Define destinations
    composable(route = homeRoute) {
        HomeScreen(navController)
    }
    composable(route = detailsRoute) { backStackEntry ->
        val itemId = backStackEntry.arguments?.getString("itemId")
        DetailsScreen(navController, itemId)
    }
}

// Navigating to a route
navController.navigate("details/123")
In this example:

homeRoute and detailsRoute are routes. They are unique string identifiers used to specify where to navigate.
The composable blocks inside NavHost define destinations. Each destination is associated with a route and represents a screen in the navigation graph.
Key Points:
A route is a string identifier used to navigate to a destination.
A destination is a defined screen or target in the navigation graph that users can navigate to, identified by a route.
Understanding this distinction helps in properly configuring and navigating through different parts of an app in Jetpack Compose.



Share view model across a navigation graph jetpack compose


Sharing a ViewModel across a navigation graph in Jetpack Compose can be achieved using the NavBackStackEntry and hiltViewModel() (if you're using Hilt for dependency injection) or viewModel() from the navigation-compose library. Here's how you can do it:

Using Hilt for Dependency Injection
Setup Hilt in your project: Make sure you have Hilt set up in your project. Add the necessary dependencies to your build.gradle files and annotate your Application class and activities as required.

Create a shared ViewModel: Define your ViewModel and annotate it with @HiltViewModel.
