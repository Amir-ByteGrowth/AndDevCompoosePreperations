Data To UI Phases
 jetpack compose has three phases to convert data to UI.
    1- Composition (what to show) (here we build the code and build ui tree)
    2- Layout      (Where to place it)
        Three things are done here
            1- Measure children size
            2- Decide Own Size
            3- Place children
            (at the end each node will have h,w and x,y positions where to place it. each node is visited only once)
    3- Drawing     (How to render it)
        Things are drawn from top to bottom (Row( Image,Column (Text,Text)))

The order of these phases is generally the same, allowing data to flow in one direction from
composition to layout to drawing to produce a frame (also known as unidirectional data flow).
BoxWithConstraints and LazyColumn and LazyRow are notable exceptions, where the composition of its
children depends on the parent's layout phase.

 Composition
    In the composition phase, the Compose runtime executes composable functions and outputs a tree
    structure that represents your UI. This UI tree consists of layout nodes that contain all the
    information needed for the next phases

 Layout
    In the layout phase, Compose uses the UI tree produced in the composition phase as input. The
    collection of layout nodes contain all the information needed to decide on each node's size and
    location in 2D space.

 Drawing
    In the drawing phase, the tree is traversed again from top to bottom, and each node draws itself
    on the screen in turn.
