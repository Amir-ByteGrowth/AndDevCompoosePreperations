Work states

Work goes through a series of State changes over its lifetime.

One-time work states

For a one-time work request, your work begins in an ENQUEUED state.

In the ENQUEUED state, your work is eligible to run as soon as its Constraints and initial delay timing
requirements are met. From there it moves to a RUNNING state and then depending on the outcome of the work
it may move to SUCCEEDED, FAILED, or possibly back to ENQUEUED if the result is retry. At any point in the process,
work can be cancelled, at which point it will move to the CANCELLED state.

Figure 1 illustrates the life of one-time work, with the events that may take it to another state.



Figure 1. State diagram for one-time work.

SUCCEEDED, FAILED and CANCELLED all represent a terminal state for this work. If your work is in any of
these states, WorkInfo.State.isFinished() returns true.


Periodic work states

Success and failed states apply only to one-time and chained work. For periodic work, there is only
one terminal state, CANCELLED. This is because periodic work never ends. After each run, itâ€™s rescheduled,
regardless of the result. Figure 2 depicts the condensed state diagram for periodic work.
