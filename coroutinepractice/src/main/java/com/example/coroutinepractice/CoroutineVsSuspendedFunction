coroutine vs suspended function ?

In Kotlin, coroutines and suspend functions are related concepts but serve different purposes:

Coroutines:
Definition: Coroutines are a concurrency design pattern that allows you to write asynchronous code in a sequential manner. They are lightweight threads that can be suspended and resumed without blocking the main thread.
Usage: You use coroutines to manage and control the execution of multiple tasks that can run concurrently. Coroutines can be launched using various builders like launch, async, etc.
Scope: Coroutines are typically launched within a CoroutineScope, such as GlobalScope, viewModelScope, or a custom scope.
Example:
kotlin
Copy code
viewModelScope.launch {
    // Coroutine scope code
    val data = fetchData()
    // Handle data
}
Suspend Functions:
Definition: A suspend function is a function that can be paused and resumed at a later time. It can only be called from another suspend function or within a coroutine.
Usage: Suspend functions are used to perform long-running or potentially blocking operations, such as network calls or database queries, without blocking the main thread.
Characteristics: Suspend functions are marked with the suspend keyword. They can use the withContext function to switch to different dispatchers.
Example:
kotlin
Copy code
suspend fun fetchData(): String {
    return withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // Simulate network or database call
        "Data"
    }
}
Key Differences:
Purpose: Coroutines manage the lifecycle and concurrency of tasks, while suspend functions are specific tasks that can be suspended.
Execution: A coroutine is an execution unit, whereas a suspend function is a function that can be paused during execution.
Call Context: Suspend functions can only be called within a coroutine or another suspend function. Coroutines are initiated using builders like launch, async, etc.
In summary, coroutines are the broader mechanism for handling concurrency, while suspend functions are specific points within that mechanism where the execution can be paused and resumed.
