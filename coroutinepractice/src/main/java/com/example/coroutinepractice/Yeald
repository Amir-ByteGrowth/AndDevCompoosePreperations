Let other work happen using yield()
If the work youâ€™re doing is 1) CPU heavy, 2) may exhaust the thread pool and 3) you want to allow the thread to do other work without having to add more threads to the pool, then use yield(). The first operation done by yield will be checking for completion and exit the coroutine by throwing CancellationException if the job is already completed. yield can be the first function called in the periodic check, like ensureActive() mentioned above.

Using yield() in Kotlin coroutines can help manage cooperative multitasking within a coroutine. It allows other coroutines to run without adding more threads to the pool, which is useful in CPU-bound tasks where you want to avoid blocking a thread entirely.

Here's a breakdown of when and how to use yield() effectively, along with an example:

When to Use yield()
CPU-bound Tasks: If you're doing work that heavily utilizes the CPU and you want to avoid blocking other coroutines, yield() can be used to give other coroutines a chance to execute.
Avoiding Thread Pool Exhaustion: When too many coroutines are executing on a limited number of threads, yield() allows you to let the current coroutine pause and give way to others, preventing thread starvation.
Cooperative Cancellation: Using yield() can help with cancellation propagation by checking if the coroutine is still active. If the coroutine's job is canceled, yield() will throw a CancellationException, allowing the coroutine to terminate gracefully.
Example
Let's look at a practical example of how to use yield() within a coroutine:

kotlin
Copy code
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // Launch a CPU-bound task
    val job = launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
        for (i in 1..5) {
            if (isActive) {  // Ensure the coroutine is still active
                doCpuBoundTask(i)
                yield()  // Allow other coroutines to run
            } else {
                println("Coroutine is no longer active, exiting.")
                return@launch
            }
        }
    }

    // Launch another coroutine to demonstrate cooperative multitasking
    val anotherJob = launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
        repeat(5) { i ->
            println("Another task running: Step $i")
            delay(100)  // Simulate some work
        }
    }

    // Wait for a short time and then cancel the job
    delay(300)
    job.cancelAndJoin()
    println("Main program complete")
}

suspend fun doCpuBoundTask(step: Int) {
    println("Performing CPU-bound task: Step $step")
    // Simulate some CPU work
    for (i in 1..1_000_000) {
        // Dummy calculation to mimic CPU-bound work
        val temp = i * i
    }
}
Explanation
Coroutine Launching: We launch a coroutine on the Default dispatcher, which is optimized for CPU-bound tasks. The for loop simulates a series of CPU-bound steps.
Yielding Control: After each step, yield() is called. This temporarily pauses the coroutine, allowing other coroutines (such as anotherJob) to run.
Cooperative Cancellation: Before doing the task and after yielding, we check if the coroutine is still isActive. This ensures that the coroutine can exit gracefully if canceled.
Demonstrating Concurrency: By launching another coroutine (anotherJob), we show that yield() lets this coroutine run concurrently, demonstrating cooperative multitasking.
Cancellation: The main function cancels the CPU-bound job after a delay, illustrating how a coroutine can be canceled and will stop executing its tasks.
Benefits
Efficiency: Improves the efficiency of the thread pool by allowing other coroutines to make progress without requiring more threads.
Responsiveness: Keeps the application responsive by enabling concurrent execution without blocking threads.
Cancellation Support: Facilitates graceful cancellation and resource cleanup by checking for active status before continuing with work.
