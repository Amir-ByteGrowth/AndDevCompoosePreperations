what is bound service?

Bound Service
Usage: Allows components (like activities, fragments, or other services) to bind to the service, and
communicate with it through inter-process communication (IPC).
Thread: Operates on the main (UI) thread by default. Threading must be handled manually using worker threads.
Lifecycle:
onCreate() → onBind() → Bound → onUnbind() → onDestroy()
Termination: The service runs only as long as another component is bound to it. Once all clients are unbound, it stops.
Example: Music playback where the UI needs to control the player.
Special Note: A bound service does not need a persistent notification.

// we will you bound service when we want tow way communication with service, here bound service act as
server and your component becomes client,

1- onCreate()
2- onBind()
all clients are bound to the services

3- onUnbind() return true or false
all clients unbind by calling unbindService()

4- (optional)- onRebind() it will trigger only when we return true from onUnbind() method if its value is false then next lifecycle method will be onDestroy()

5- onDestroy()
